FindCuboids --> EnqueueCuboids : Starts Many
FindCuboids --- S3Index : Gets cuboids belonging to channel
EnqueueCuboids --> CuboidSqs : Adds cuboid object keys
CuboidSqs --> CuboidSupervisor : Starts Many
CuboidSupervisor --- CuboidBucket : Get cuboid
CuboidSupervisor --> FanoutIdWriters : Starts Many
FanoutIdWriters --- S3Index : Get cuboid's ids
FanoutIdWriters --> IndexIdsSqs: Enqueue cuboid's ids in batches
IndexIdsSqs --> IdWriter : Starts Many
CuboidSupervisor --> S3Index : Writes ids to cuboid's id-set
IdWriter --> IdIndex : Adds cuboid object key to id's set of cuboids
