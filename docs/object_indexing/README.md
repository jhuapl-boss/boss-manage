# Object Indexing Design Documentation

Last updated 12 Aug 2021.

This folder contains the diagrams describing the step functions used to create
the index of object ids that reside in the DynamoDB tables: `s3index` and 
`idIndex`

Original diagrams are generated using https://www.draw.io  However, changes to
their site (now https://diagrams.net), no longer allow running external JS code
used by the step function plugin library.

Currently, most of the original designs are unchanged, but `Index.IdWriter` and
`Index.FanoutIdWriters` have new designs.  Their diagrams were generated by
PlantUML.  PlantUML will be used going forward due to its all text format.

Original instructions for opening the first design:

Load the original diagrams by going to the web site and selecting:

`File | Open From | Device`

Next give it the file `Id Indexing Design.draw.io.xml`

`.png` versions of the diagrams were created by using `File | Export as`
