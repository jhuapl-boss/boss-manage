CM->SC: Get DELAYED-WRITE keys
loop for each DELAYED-WRITE key
    CM->SC: Check PAGEOUT set for cuboid
    alt If DELAYED-WRITE key not in PAGEOUT set
        CM->SC: Try add WRITE-CUBOID key to PAGEOUT set
        alt Successfully added to PAGEOUT set
            CM->FQ: Enqueue cuboid for writing to S3
            CM->>FL: Async invoke lambda
            FL->FQ: Get message with keys for cuboid to write to S3
            FL->KC: Get actual cuboid data (removes DELAYED-WRITE and RESOURCE keys during this step)
            FL->CB: Write cuboid
            FL->KC: If cuboid has a CACHE-KEY, update its data
            FL->KC: Remove cuboid's WRITE-CUBOID key
            FL->SC: Remove WRITE-CUBOID key from PAGEOUT set
            FL->FQ: Remove message
