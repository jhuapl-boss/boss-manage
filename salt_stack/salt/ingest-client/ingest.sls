# Install moto dependency separately.  Salt sets LC_ALL=C which breaks
# install of httpretty due to a Unicode error.  Unfortunately, can't
# override this variable in the pip.installed state using env_vars.  Salt
# probably sets LC_ALL after it sets the environment to  the contents of
# env_vars.  This will probably be fixed in a new version of Salt (newer
# than 8/2015).  See https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/19924 and
# https://github.com/saltstack/salt/pull/29340.
