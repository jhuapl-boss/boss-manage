# Bosslet Configuration Files
Each Boss instance (bosslet) is defined by a configuration file. A commented example Bosslet configuration file is saved as `boss_config.py.example` and can be used as the base for an new configuration files.

The Bosslet configuration file `boss_config.py` translates into `boss.config` when using any of the `boss-manage/bin/` scripts.

Bosslet configuration files can be placed in either this directory or `./custom/`, allowing you to have a private GIT repository for managing multiple Bosslet configuration files if desired.
